This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a React application with Auth0. The sample makes use of Auth0's hosted login page which provides centralized authentication. The sample uses create-react-app.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
npm install
```

## Run the Application

The development server that comes with create-react-app can be used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-and-domain).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.
